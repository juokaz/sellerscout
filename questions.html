                        You sign up with us by providing a bit of information about your e-commerce store and yourself. Together we then find your competitors and start working on getting the data from their stores using our spiders. Just after a few days data is ready to be viewed and you get immediate access.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will see your products’ margins, what products need attention and historical price’s changes. Plus various statistics, analytics and graphs detailing how your products are doing.

                <div class="even-more question">
                    <h2>Even more...</h2>
                    <p>
                        If your e-commerce software allows that, we can automatically handle price changes. You just define rules like “keep all products at least 5% cheaper than my competitors, not going lower than the wholesale price” and it just happens. Once rules like that are setup and we have tested them, your store is always at the market position you want it to be. No magic involved!

                <div class="how-much-this-is-going-to-cost question">
                    <h2>How much this is going to cost?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Prices are not final yet, but expect the price to be based on how many competitors you want to track and how much products that involves. We are going to work with you personally to make this happen. It’s a service, so it’s going to have a fixed price payable each month, and you can stop using it any time you want too.
                    </p>
                    <p>We want this to be beneficial for you, so the price you will be paying is supposed to be just a portion of your increased sales or long-term market position. The goal of this service is to help to make your store more competitive and we think this is wort a lot. 
                    </p>
