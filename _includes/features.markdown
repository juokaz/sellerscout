                    <h2>Automatic</h2>
                    We handle everything, absolutely everything. You don’t need to supply us any data, connect products or help us with the data retrieval - that’s our job and we do it really well. 
                </div>

                <div class="up-to-date feature">
                    <h2>Up-to-date</h2>
                    Data is updated at least once a day, so you can be sure that you are not acting upon outdated information. If you ask so, we can make it almost-realtime, so you know immediately when prices change.
                </div>

                <div class="flexible feature">
                    <h2>Flexible</h2>
                    Our little spiders or as we call them scouts, will work with any website or e-commerce store. They will go there, figure out how to get products information and get back with that. Again, not a thing you’d need to worry about, but just to make you sure that we can handle any of your competitors. 
                </div>

                <div class="full-api-access feature">
                    <h2>Full API access</h2>
                    If you have in-house developers they can integrate SellerScout to your internal systems or we can help you with that. Just mention the word API to them, and they will know what to do next.
